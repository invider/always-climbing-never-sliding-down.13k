=== liminal gap tracer ===

--- phase III - advanced features and procedural generation ---
> minify the package to fit 13k space budget
> random placement of block connection points
> disable connection points which are already in contact
> multiple block sizes
> megacity growth in multiple directions but with westward preference
> leveling blocks based on a noise function
> texture and noises atlas visualization
> megacity block structure visualization
> noise-based block structure and multiple cell types (gaps, platforms, obstacle cells, monotliths)
> noise-based floppies seeding
> jump pads and huge block gaps on jump connections

> make jumps the function of speed - run fast to jump higher
> autorun
> gamepad support

--- phase IV - polish ---


=== zap framework ===
> tweening
> fog
> multiple lights support
> spotlight
> bump mapping
> smog (like fog, only below, after certain DY shift)
> 3d mini-font
> sfx generator #sound
> sfx controller #sound
> synth engine #sound
> sequencer #sound
-- nice to have
> indexed faces & elem array support #optimization
> .obj loader #tooling
> .mtl loader #tooling

> figure out point light diffuse dark spots (when turn?)
> handle "the user has exited the lock before this request was completed"
> handle WebGL lost context issue
